<font size="+2"><b>General Remarks</b></font> <br> <br>
This section contains some general remarks about tackling this challenge.  These are considerations that either apply throughout the whole run, or aren't zone specific.
<hr>
<font size="+1"><b>Assumed Knowledge and Ability</b></font> <br> <br>
This guide is written assuming that you are completely comfortable playing as Aria.  A good heuristic is whether you feel comfortable clearing Aria low% (not just having a clear, but feeling like you are somewhat consistent at it).
<hr>
<font size="+1"><b>Moving in Wrong Music</b></font> <br> <br>
This is the first hurdle to this challenge: being able to move while the wrong music is playing as Aria.  You don't get to drop a beat; how on earth is this possible? <br> <br>
More than anything else about this challenge, this might be the single most approchable aspect here.  The gulf between there being no music and wrong music isn't large; before reading my advice, I strongly recommend trying out regular Aria with either no music or wrong music playing and see where you get. <br> <br>
Now that you're back, I will talk about two things: how I read the beat, and what considerations I have to make for wrong music.  There are many things that one can read the beat off of while playing; the four that I use (in order of most to least) are the disco floor, Aria's animations, enemy animations, and the beat bars.  More than anything, the beat bars are there to calibrate myself at the very start of a run and to get me started on King Conga.  Otherwise, I almost always just use the disco floor and animations. <br> <br>
As for considerations that I make to account for wrong music, the biggest one is to simplify my builds and my plans.  Setting up plans that require more calculation or need more improvization but are faster or could give you stronger items is a bad tradeoff when you have to expend more mental energy to keep the beat.  I also tend to grab items that maybe are simpler and weaker but don't take as much mental strain to compute with.  The other main difference is that, if I start drifting off beat and don't actively work to correct it, I eventually will lose the beat.  I need to regularly check that I am on beat and not ahead or behind.

<font size="+1"><b>What hard mode does</b></font> <br> <br>
This is a short reminder of everything that hard mode does:
<ul>
<li> There are more enemies per floor. </li>
<li> There is an extra miniboss per floor. </li>
<li> There are sarcophagi, that can only be destroyed by bombs, that continuously spawn enemies. </li>
<li> In every non-story boss, there are two extra minibosses.  These minibosses are fixed; the list below gives the minibosses and tells you which side they spawn on:
<ul>
<li> Zone 5: Metrognome and Brown Dragon </li>
<li> Zone 4: Mummy and Ogre </li>
<li> Zone 3: Minotaur and Nightmare </li>
<li> Zone 2: Nightmare and Banshee </li>
<li> Zone 1: Irrelevant, because Aria has a story boss here </li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
