This section will be discussing zone 5.  There is a lot to talk about here and this will be the longest zone specific section of this guide.

By far, the most important part of zone 5 is mapping.  Given that you are so low on resources when you start the game, opening a door into a room with a purple sarcophagus that you don't need to deal with is incredibly punishing.  This is something that I've found a lot of people struggle with, but can be somewhat straightforward.  Here are a few tips about mapping: <br>
<ul>
<li> The exit room is 8 by 8, and is at least 7 tiles away from the starting room.  All other rooms are 5 by 4. </li>
<li> There are no traps nor purple sarcophagi in the exit room.  This is true* throughout the game, but knowing this is highest leverage in zone 5. </li>
<li> The door to the exit room is in the main hallway.  Additionally, there are no other doors in the exit room. </li>
<li> If push comes to shove and you don't have a read on the exit, you can dig walls near doors to take a peek inside.  This works well with the base shovel, as the walls will regrow. </li>
</ul>
I put together two pages: <a href="zone5showcase.html">one</a> with 5 zone 5 levels generated in the level editor so you can see patterns, and <a href="zone5test.html">one</a> with 6 "tests" where you are shown only what's in the hallway and you should try to figure out where the exit is.  I recommend taking a look at these, especially if you aren't comfortable with zone 5 mapping.<br> <br>
