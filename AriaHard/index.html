Hello, this is my (rp2knight's) guide to clearing Aria hard wrong music.  This is a collection of observations that I have made that should be helpful to anyone attempting this challenge. <br> <br>
The links on the left are the content of this guide.  It is highly recommended to read the general remarks before reading specific sections.

Honestly, this is mainly me fiddling around with html and getting a lot of my thoughts on this topic committed to writing.  I don't know if anyone out there will want to attempt this challenge, but I hope that if someone does this will be helpful.
